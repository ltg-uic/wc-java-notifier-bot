# WallCology Teacher Notification Interface#

This is the notification interface through which teachers can access the notifications relative to fidelity of science practice and distribution of participation.

This is just the frontend, and works using BOSH (XMPP over HTTP). Make sure you take a look at tebmis/wallcology-notifier-agent to see how the notifications are generated
